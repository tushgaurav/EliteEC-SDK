# Elite EC Series Python SDK

## Introduction
There was no Python SDK for the Elite EC Series of Cobots, so I decided to make one. This SDK is based on the ELITE ROBOTS EC Series Programming Manual, provided by Elite Robots. The official manual provides functions that establish socket communication for controlling the robot. This SDK is the more pythonic version of the official manual.
